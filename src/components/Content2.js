              Who doesn’t want a Big Bro. On a more serious note, owning a Big
              Bro doesn’t only give you a revolutionized PFP but it gives you
              access to events, giveaways, and our airdrops. Big Bros is aimed
              to be mainly community driven. And because of that, all Big Bros
              holders will own full rights to their NFT. The team at Big Bros is
              excited for this journey and is committed to provide support and
              guidance as a Big Bro should always do.
