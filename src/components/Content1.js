            Big Bros is a collection of 10,000 tough Bros chilling on the
            Ethereum blockchain. The Big Bros are a combination of hand-drawn
            traits randomly designed together and generated through a computer
            program. Our mission as Bros is to grow as much as we can and
            support each Bro through rewards and giveaways.
