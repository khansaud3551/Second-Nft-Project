      <h2>Why own a Big Bro?</h2>
      <p>
        Owning a Big Bro doesn’t only give you a revolutionized PFP but it gives
        you access to events, giveaways, and our airdrops. Big Bros is aimed to
        be mainly community driven. And because of that, all Big Bros holders
        will own full rights to their NFT. The team at Big Bros is excited for
        this journey and is committed to provide support and guidance as a Big
        Bro should always do.
      </p>
      <h2>How can you mint?</h2>
      <p>
        Minting a Big Bro is simple. Have your wallet setup (MetaMask preferred)
        with some ETH loaded in. Once you’re all set with setting up a wallet,
        go ahead and hit the “connect wallet” button on our site. After that,
        you will be able to mint by clicking the “Mint” button. Upon entering
        the amount of Bros you want and confirming the transaction you are done.
        You now own a Big Bro.
      </p>
      <h2>What’s next?</h2>
      <p>
        Once you minted your Big Bros, you can check them out on OpenSea! Make
        sure to follow and keep notifications on for our Twitter to ensure you
        don’t miss out on the giveaways we mentioned.
      </p>
      <h2>What do you own with a Big Bro?</h2>
      <p>
        Not only do you get an amazing PFP but owning a Big Bro means you own
        everything about it. IP rights included. Wanna make some merch for your
        bro? Use your Big Bro as the design! There are endless things you can do
        by owning the IP rights of your Bro.
      </p>
      <h2>How many Big Bros are out there?</h2>
      <p>
        We plan on having a total of 10,000 Big Bros created. An approximate of
        100 will be reserved strictly for the giveaways listed on our roadmap.
